üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage
This is a self-contained web application. You don't need a backend server to run it locally.

Prerequisites

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

1. File Placement

Create a new folder for the project.

Place all three files (index.html, styles.css, and script.js) inside this folder.

2. Running the Application

Simply open index.html in your web browser.

3. Using the AI Features

AI Description & Pricing: Navigate to "Register" and then "Add New Product." Fill in the product details and click "Generate AI Description" or "Suggest Price."

AI Comparison: Click on "Compare" in the navigation. Enter your product details and click "Generate Comparison" to see a full market analysis.

AI Suggestions: Click on "Suggest" in the navigation and then "Get Trending Product Ideas" to generate a list of new product concepts.

üß† AI Integration Details
API: The application uses the Gemini API for all AI-powered features.

Prompts: The prompts are carefully structured to generate specific outputs, such as concise product descriptions or detailed JSON objects for market analysis.

Structured Output: The generateStructuredContentWithGemini function is used to ensure that the API returns data in a predictable JSON format, which allows the application to parse and display the information correctly.

üîç Troubleshooting
API Key: Ensure you have an active Gemini API key. The API_KEY variable in script.js is currently empty. To use the AI features, you will need to add a valid key.

Network Errors: If the AI features do not work, check your browser's console for network errors. This could indicate a problem with the API key or a network issue.

UI Glitches: The application uses CSS for its layout and responsiveness. If you encounter any visual issues, try resizing the browser window or clearing your browser's cache.

Happy Crafting! üé®‚ú®
